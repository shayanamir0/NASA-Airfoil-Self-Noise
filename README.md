## Introduction
Airfoil self-noise is a significant factor in the design and operation of various aircrafts. This project aims to predict the self-noise levels of airfoils using machine learning models. Accurate predictions can help in designing quieter and more efficient airfoils.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/291/airfoil+self+noise). It contains various attributes such as frequency, angle of attack, chord length, free-stream velocity, and suction side displacement thickness, along with the corresponding sound pressure levels.

## Model Training and Results
The project employs several regression models to predict the sound pressure level based on the given features. Below is a overview of the models used:

- **Linear Regression**- MSE : 22.128, R-squared : 0.558
- **Polynomial Regression(Degree 2)**- MSE : 15.828, R-squared : 0.684
- **Polynomial Regression(Degree 3)**- MSE : 12.057, R-squared : 0.759
- **Decision Tree**- MSE : 5.876, R-squared : 0.882
- **Random Forest**- MSE : 3.315, R-squared : 0.933
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**- MSE : 2.685, R-squared : 0.946
- **Neural Network**- MSE : 17.246, R-squared : 0.655
- **Ensemble Model**- MSE : 2.669, R-squared : 0.946

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting airfoil sound pressure levels. The results show that the model can achieve accurate predictions, making it a valuable tool for aircraft design optimization and research.
